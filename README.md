_This document is intended to be a template for working groups established by the TAC, to be used as the README.md file in its repository. All items in italics are descriptions of what context should be there; it is intended to be replaced by content. It is modeled off the [CNCF Serverless WG](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless)._

_The intention is that each WG has its own GitHub repo under the [Open Mainframe Project organization](https://github.com/openmainframeproject)._

# _Working group name_

COBOL
The nature of the COBOL group will be to target leading luminaries in the COBOL world help espouse the technology’s usage and vitality. Such membership should be a broad scope including suggestions such as – major COBOL technology vendors (Micro Focus, IBM, Broadcom, BMC/Compuware, Fujitsu, GNUCOBOL); COBOL modernization specialist organizations (Astadia, BMC/RSM, COBOL Cowboys); Training and Educational organizations (LEAD-IT, Interskill, IT-ology); and end-user commercial organizations who wish to join (probably sensible to permit all other members to invite end-user participation). The alignment to point B is not exact because the group is more of a leadership forum than a practitioner one. For the avoidance of doubt this group must declare also that it will not act as a voice for commentary on the future of the COBOL standard, or provide recommendations on one form of COBOL over another. It will agree to the scope of options available but outside of that remain impartial to anything that is considered implementation-specific

_Goals are the distinct outcomes that is to be anticipated from the working group, serving as a method for validating activities._

Goals of the COBOL Working Group are:

Establishing a group of COBOL thought leaders and exponents aims to address misunderstanding about the technology and promote its continued usage, learning and discourse. 
Specifically, this project aims to:

1. Greatly increase COBOL’s exposure to the public, specifically the IT decision-makers who will directly affect how widely COBOL will be employed in the future; 
2. Clearly describe why COBOL should return to the general college curriculum;
3. Gather data and promote COBOL’s importance to the global economy;
4. Provide avenues by which those seeking COBOL skills can acquire them.
5. Establish a group of thought leaders and key persons in this space to act as global proponents and commentators on the language and its enduring value.
6. Establish an industry approved curriculum for a COBOL course for colleges and universities at several levels (introductory, intermediate, advanced).

_Non-goals are things that the working group are intentionally choosing not to do, the things not expected to change due to the working groups efforts, or the subject matter areas that the working groups doesn’t want to address at this time. _

Non-goals of the COBOL Working Group are:

1. Having a vendor or platform specific perspective on COBOL as a language.
2. Showing a preference to a specific vendor.
3. Focus on a specific version of COBOL.

The TAC member sponsor of this working group is Len Santalucia.

## Deliverables

_provide a list of planned deliverables, or links to the deliverables. A best practice is to have a directory named [deliverables](deliverables) in the repo for hosting and managing deliverables._

Near term: A COBOL roundtable with thought leaders in this space.
Medium term: A standard COBOL curriculum for colleges and universities.
